The project comprises three worksheets with different functionalities: Worksheet 1 Show only employees who are ‘Freelancers’ and highlight the ones whose salaries are above $10000, Worksheet 2 splits employee full names into first and last names while highlighting any duplicates, and Worksheet 3 highlights employees whose names begin with the letter 'E' and formats the salary column based on salary values.

## Skills Demonstrated
1. Data Manipulation
2. Use of Conditional Formatting
3. Use of Filters
4. Text-to-Column

2. Formatting Salary column: The salary column will be formatted with a green background for the highest salary value and a red background for the lowest salary value.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Employee Information Management project provided us with a practical and hands-on learning experience in data manipulation and analysis using Microsoft Excel. Throughout the project, we demonstrated various essential skills, including data manipulation, conditional formatting, filter usage, and the text-to-column feature.

The project was divided into three worksheets, each with distinct functionalities. Worksheet 1 contained a well-organized table with 20 rows of employee information, such as Employee ID, Employee Full Name, Department, Salary, and Job Type.

In Worksheet 2, we successfully filtered and displayed only those employees who are 'Freelancers' and whose salaries exceed $10,000. This allowed us to focus on a specific subset of employees that met the specified criteria.

In Worksheet 3, we split the Employee Full Name column into separate First Name and Last Name columns, enhancing the organization of the data. Additionally, any duplicate names were highlighted, providing us with a quick visual reference for potential data inconsistencies.

Furthermore, Worksheet 3 featured two distinct functionalities. Firstly, we highlighted employees whose names started with the letter 'E' in yellow, which made it easier to identify employees whose names shared a common characteristic. Secondly, we formatted the Salary column to have a green background for the highest salary value and a red background for the lowest salary value, facilitating an immediate understanding of salary distribution.

This project not only strengthened our proficiency in Microsoft Excel but also showcased the practical application of data analysis techniques in managing employee information effectively. As part of Promise Nonso's data analysis cohort, we look forward to building upon the skills acquired during this project and applying them to more complex real-world scenarios in the future. With this solid foundation, we are confident in our ability to make informed decisions and draw valuable insights from data, empowering us to contribute meaningfully to the field of data analysis.
